The @code{\circle} command allows you to draw circles around various objects,
for example fingering indications. However, some objects require
specific tweaks: rehearsal marks depend on the @code{Score.markFormatter}
context, bar numbers on the @code{Score.BarNumber} context, and so on.

You can tweak the printing of your circles by setting some properties
such as @code{#'thickness}, @code{#'circle-padding} or @code{#'font-size}.
